# Ikea-Check-List
## This app is a shopping list, you can add items and check them off as you get them. In this demonstration the shopping list is Ikea themed as we were planning an Ikea shop for our new appartment. It has an unusual background as I was playing with the gradient a little to long but its purpose is to demonstrate HTML, CSS and intermediate JavaScript. The user has the ability to add, remove and check off items on the list and I used JavaScript to store the values.
